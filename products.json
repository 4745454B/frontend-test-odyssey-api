   "description": "Here is my Atari Punk Console no-solder breadboard kit. I wanted to put together a kit that could be built quickly and easily, for people with little or no experience with audio electronics. It would make an ideal gift for the musician or technology geek in your life!\nIt's a design based upon the 'Stepped Tone Generator', a circuit created by Forrest Mimms III. It's not complicated, you really can build a synthesiser and be making electronic sounds 10 minutes!\nIt's uses a 556 dual timer chip, along with a few other resistors and capacitors, plus a 2-watt speaker. Also included are a jack socket and a few extra parts to enable you to take it a step further and connect it to an amp or some guitar effects pedals to really make some noise!\nPlease note - A battery is not included, you will need to supply a 9V PP3 battery.",

   "description": "Tiger Electronic is a great vintage handheld. Sonic The Hedgehog 3 comes is in good condition considering its age with some light surface scratches / scuffs. This is a common fault. The battery cover is still present and opens and closes fine. Sonic The Hedgehog 3 is fully working when batteries are inserted. It is stamped with '1988 Tiger Electronics, Inc. Made In China' on the back. The original instructions are included and have a little tear, some creasing and marks. It also includes its original cardback which has been opened along three sides and has some wear, splits/cracks and pieces of the edge missing, as shown but this doesn't detract from this great vintage game in any way. It has an impressive illustration on the front and is printed with '1994 TIGER ELECTRONICS (UK) LLC.' and 'Made in China' on the back. Tiger Electronic is a must for any Sonic The Hedgehog or retro gaming fan.",

   "description": "Rakit Disintegrated Cracklebox\nBuild rating: EASY\nPlay rating: Moderate-Hard\nOur disintegrated cracklebox kit is inspired by Michel Waisvisz’s Cracklebox and his use (and abuse!) of one of the earliest examples of an integrated operational amplifier. The original used the LM709, an old (and obsolete) chip by today’s standards. So in our kit we have effectively taken the integrated circuit of the operational amplifier and dis-integrated it, allowing it to live on forever in kit form.\nKit Assembly\nThis kit is rated as easy, takes around an hour to make and is suitable for all ages. The only equipment needed to complete this kit is a soldering iron and a pair of flush cutters. 100cm of our favourite lead free solder is included!\nThe easy to follow, detailed assembly guide can be followed online on our website Rakits.co.uk It contains handy hints and tips to help you along the way! We are unable to provide individual customer support with kit building so please see the assembly guide to gauge difficulty before purchasing. Once started, kits cannot be refunded.\nWhat Is A Cracklebox?\nThe Rakit Disintegrated Cracklebox is a noise maker type instrument where the player becomes part of the circuit by interacting with the touchpads. Experimentation really is key to getting the most out of it, using fingers spread over multiple touchpads to get new, interesting sounds.\nDue to the nature of the beast, playing the Cracklebox requires practise to UNLEASH IT’S POTENTIAL! Because the user is part of the circuit, different people will get different results. Even touching someone who is playing the Cracklebox will affect the sound produced! You can watch a video demo of the Rakit Disintegrated Cracklebox here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7q4dvZrSmw\nThe kit comes with a 9V pp3 battery to barrel jack connector as standard.\nThe user can optionally replace this with a 9V centre positive power supply.\nWe recommend using an alkaline battery, this is NOT INCLUDED in the kit.\nGift wrapping option is available at checkout. Please leave us a note with your chosen style (option 1-5 pictured in listing photos) and the message you would like us to write in the card!\nWhat's included in the Rakit Disintegrated Cracklebox Kit:\nPCB 1\nRubber Feet 4\n10n Ceramic Capacitor 2\n100n Ceramic Capacitor 1\n2n2 Ceramic Capacitor 1\n100u Electrolytic Capacitor 1\n2N3904 Transistor 15\n2N3906 Transistor 4\n​​​​​​​Mono Jack 1\nSPDT Slide Switch 1\n5.5mm x 2.1mm Barrel Socket Plus Barrel Jack Battery Connector 1\nSpeaker 1\nRectangular Blue LED 1\n27k Resistor 2\n3k Resistor 2\n10k Resistor 5\n1k Resistor 1\n3k6 Resistor 1\n18k Resistor 1\n2.4k Resistor 1\n75R Resistor 1\n20k Resistor 1\n30k Resistor 1\n1M Resistor 1\n1m/ 2-3g Lead Free Solder\n​​​​​​​",

   "description": "A complete DIY kit that will significantly reduce the hum and noise from your electric guitar or bass. It is particularly effective on guitars with single-coil pickups (e.g. Fender Strat) but even guitars with humbucking pickups often have unshielded wiring, pots and switches, and will benefit from this kit.\nIn a live situation, buzzes from lighting dimmers and transformers are greatly reduced. In the studio, the improved signal to noise ratio makes everything easier— you'll spend less time walking around the room or spinning on a chair trying to find the sweet-spot where the noise nulls out! And the guitar just sounds better - low level harmonics that were previously buried in the mains hum and noise are now audible, making the overall sound richer and more dynamic. I have supplied many hundreds of these kits - people are amazed at the improvement it makes, especially on the DIY \"build your own guitar\" kits that are popular now.\nThe outward appearance of the guitar is unchanged. If you are comfortable with changing strings and using a screwdriver, pair of scissors and a paintbrush you'll find it simple and straightforward to fit.\nThe standard kit includes:\n- Conductive graphite shielding paint (30ml)\n- Copper foil (self-adhesive, 30cm x 20cm) for plastic scratchplates & control covers\n- Accessory pack with brush, cleaning wipes, stirrer, insulation strip and detailed step-by-step photo instructions\n- Terminal block to reconnect the wiring without soldering (this is optional, you can solder if you wish!)\n- Email support\nYou can add extra paint, foil and accessory kits to your order - the components are listed separately. Shipping on extra items ordered with the kit is FREE. You can also a request a custom order.\nIf you want to hear the difference, check the video in the \"about\" section of the shop. The 3D graph in the last photo shows the effect of the kit on an untreated guitar. The noise at all frequencies is considerably reduced, especially the really annoying buzz from the lighting dimmer (blue peak). Some mains hum remains (light green peak). This is unavoidable with single coil pickups. The only way to reduce it further is by shielding the pickup covers, but most people would find this unacceptable as it will change the sound of the guitar - some of the top-end clarity and attack will be lost. (This is why you often see Telecasters with the front pickup cover removed). And the hiss? Well, hiss is usually due to the electronics in the signal chain, not interference. In this case the hiss is my 30 year old valve combo.... sounds great when you actually play something though ;-)\nPlease note: All guitars are different - the degree of noise reduction you obtain from fitting this kit will depend on several factors, e.g. pickup type, internal wiring layout, and any shielding already fitted (existing shielding paint may not be obvious), so please check your guitar before buying, and if in doubt contact me for advice.",

Although it is fairly smooth some sanding is needed before painting. The top dome is pre drilled ready for the chrome bezel. Also included is the centre ring with pre drilled holes for the front lighting and 2 part handle grip. The ready to instal internal electronics are supplied with amplified speaker designed by myself. All printed parts will need some sanding and painting. A complete guide is in the link below. The electronics include a kill switch to stop the rechargeable battery draining and once assembled all wires and circuits are enclosed for ease of use. The battery is recharged with a USB cable, also supplied.\nA complete guide to building this can be found on my YouTube channel, see the link below.\nAll electronic parts are of a high standard with bright white front LED’s, quality cables, upgraded amplified sound speaker and red light with supplied chrome bezel.\nA mini stand is also included with this kit.\nNOTE: These are made to order and so will take approximatly 2 weeks to make, no more.

   "description": "Hilger & Watts Vertical Microscopic \"Microptic\" Measuring Machine\nThis is a classic microscopic measuring machine dating back to the late 40s and 50s. Hilger & Watts were British manufacturers of precise optical measurement equipment and this is quite a rare find as most Microptic machines remaining are horizontal rather than the vertical variety\nThis machine was still working up until January-20 and probably only needs calibrating and a new plug attaching to get it back on its feet. Alas, it falls foul of many health and safety regulations these days, mainly due to its wiring, however, someone will either want to get it back to health or clean it up and have it as a display piece.\nThe machine is sold as not working, however, I believe it wouldn't take much to get it working, though these days I'd wonder what you'd want to use it for.\nIt's a beautiful piece of kit and would brilliant as part of someones collection or museum piece\nAs most of our items are antique or vintage, we cannot guarantee all items are in pristine condition and whilst we will flag any significant imperfections, the old mark, dent or nibble may pass through.

   "description": "This is a DIY construction kit, not a finished board. This kit will include the 9 nixie displays needed for assembly.\nThe first and only Nixie-powered OXO (tic-tac-toe / noughts and crosses) in the world.\nNo plugs, Induction coils power the pieces right through the board.\nA neat desk toy which takes up much less space than our chessboard but still very playable.\nSupplied with five '0' (zero) pieces and four 'X' (Plus) pieces, '0' goes first and then take turns placing pieces anywhere you want on the board, they'll light up as soon as you put them down.\nBack in a new easier to build through hole part design with IN-4 and IN-7 nixies as the 'O', only 40 of this version will be made available due to the limited number of parts available. These symbol nixie tubes are now in short supply and once they're gone, that's it. Game over.\nKit contents:\nAll PCBs and components\n4x IN7 nixies\n5x IN4 nixies\n9x Piece bases\nPaxolin case parts and engraved board top - you'll need to fill in the engravings with a paint of your choice.\n12V power supply.\nYou'll need to supply sandpaper, paint for the engraved board and to colour the piece bases, basic tools and patience.

   "description": "High quality Yageo MFR-25FRF 0.25W metal film resistors. Branded through hole resistors from a franchised source. For quality builds, stick with high quality, branded parts.\nTight tolerance of 1% means much better accuracy than other 5% parts. It's not essential but cost vs 5% is negligible, so best to make your circuit as it was designed to perform.\nVery low temperature coefficient of 50ppm / °C (the lower value the better). As your synth warms up its important to have good temperature stability.\nA lot of the cheaper resistors on the market (especially from Far East) have a very poor temperature stability - this can be tested easily with a cigarette lighter and an ohm meter !\nLow thermal noise is also an important characteristic as resistors are used in every stage of your signal chain. Metal film have lower noise vs typical carbon types.\nFull technical details on request.",

This low cost stereo amplifier can run from either batteries or an inexpensive PSU. The project provides an angle for all interests.\nLoudspeaker requirements: The amplifier can be used with any size loudspeaker in the 4 – 8 ohm range. The use of lower impedance speakers accentuates base sound – but these are less common. If more base sound is required, one method is to use two 8 ohm loudspeakers connected in parallel for each channel.\nAvailable as a kit of parts that require soldering. Board size: 66 x 35mm",

   "description": "This Atari Punk Console kit is based on the original Stepped Tone Generator by Forest M. Mimms III. It creates great lo-fi sounds resembling those from the old style Atari games using an astable square wave oscillator.\nThe main features of the kit are a 9v battery connector snap, an on/off power switch, a 3.5mm jack so that it can be hooked up to other devices such as an amp, speaker or headphones, and two knobs to control the pitch and depth of the quirky raspy tones produced.\nTo further customise the Atari Punk Console there are pads for soldering in the speaker included. There is also an extension strip with CV inputs for connecting the APC to other devices such as our Baby 8 Step Sequencer.\nThe kit includes lead free solder and a connector kit (consisting of two strips of pin header sockets plus jumper wires) for connecting the APC to devices such as our Baby 8 Sequencer kit.\nThis kit is rated as easy, takes around 20-45 mins to make and is suitable for all ages. For safety it is recommended that all children are supervised during assembly!\nEach kit contains clearly labelled parts for ease of use. A detailed assembly guide with enlarged diagrams and photos with clear instructions is available to view and download on the Rakit website rakits.co.uk. We are unable to provide individual customer support with kit building so please see the assembly guide to gauge difficulty before purchasing. Once started, kits cannot be refunded.\nGift wrapping option is available at checkout. Please leave us a note with your chosen style (option 1-5 pictured in listing photos) and the message you would like us to write in the card!\nKit Includes\n* PCB\n* 500K Ohm Linear Potentiometer (x2)\n* NE556 Dual 555 Timer IC\n* 100K Resistor\n* 15K Resistor\n* 10K Resistor\n* 1K Resistor (x2)\n* 4.7K Ohm Resistor\n* 10uF Electrolytic Capacitor\n* 9volt (pp3) Battery Snap\n* 10nF Ceramic Capacitor\n* 100nF Ceramic Capacitor\n* On/Off sliding switch\n* 3.5mm Stereo Jack\n* Small Speaker\n* 2-3g Lead Free Solder\n* APC to Baby8 Connector set.\nBattery is not included.",

   "description": "So you want to make and experiment with electronic circuits and you're looking for a project kit which is a good place to start?\nWell, first the good news. There are hundreds out there and many of them are very, very good.\nThe bad news is traditional-format electronics kits offer significant limitations.\nMost electronics kits fall into one of two categories:\nPCB Based Kits - You create a circuit by soldering components to a pre-manufactured printed circuit board. Whilst these types of projects often provide a really good final circuit often for a relatively low cost, they are a 'once only' type project. Only one function is performed by the circuit and it can only be built once. In addition, you are required to have soldering skills and equipment which are not always available to those just getting started.\nBreadboard Based Kits- You purchase a kit with a breadboard (a reusable circuit board) and a package of components and the kit will usually come with instructions to build a series of circuits. These kits benefit from the ability to make and remake different circuits but are often characterised by either a high cost, a low complexity of function of the final projects or sometimes both.\nBased on traditional electronics, there's nothing out there on the market which can offer great projects with complex functionality, simplicity of construction, a low cost and the ability to make and remake circuits.\nUNTIL NOW.\nSo what's different here? The kit you see here is based around our magicCHIP technology. magicCHIP is a chip capable of performing several different functions according to the circuit in which it finds itself. For example, magicCHIP Green (the chip in this kit) is equally at home in one circuit controlling a set of traffic lights as it is having different components surrounding it and performing the function of a light-organ.\nThis kit includes a magicCHIP Green, a piece of reusable circuit board and all the components needed (and no soldering required to make and re-make) all seven of the circuits down the left hand side of this listing:",

   "description": "Good morning,\nThis is the Polaroid Supercolor 635 CL.\nThis iconic 80s instant camera is a Close Up version virtually identical to the 635 but it has an additional close lens, allowing pictures to be taken from 0.6 to 1.2 meters away from the subject.\nDelivered in its carrying bag, accompanied by its user manual, it has not been tested but its condition suggests that it was used very little and that it works well.\nThis little jewel of nostalgia will be nurtured with the help of 600 films.\nThank you for your visit.",

   "description": "Available as either a DIY kit or a ready made unit, the Rakit Metal Synth has a Polivok’s inspired filter at its core. It uses this, along with a punchy AD envelope to produce a variety of percussive sounds from shaped noise.\nIt was designed to be a companion to the Rakit Drum Synth and as such creates a range of mad/interesting sounds and some very useful metallic sounds.\n## How it Works ##\nThe synth is triggered by a piezo disc which is sensitive to how hard you tap the top panel giving subtle differences in the two stage envelope.\nThe noise is generated digitally by a pre-programmed microcontroller. The filter at the heart of the unit can be controlled and modified by the Sweep, lowpass/bandpass, Resonance, Cutoff and Cutoff CV.\n## So what do these twiddly knobs do? ##\nSENS: Sets the sensitivity of the trigger/touchpad.\nDECAY1: Sets the decay time of the louder initial hit (body).\nDECAY2: Sets the lasting decay time (tail).\nCUTOFF: Sets the filter’s cutoff frequency and the bias for control voltages to be summed with.\nSWEEP: Controls the amount of sweep applied to the cutoff frequency.\nRES: Sets the filter’s resonance. The filter will oscillate at max!\nAUX IN: A mono input of your choosing.\nTRIGGER, CUTOFF CV, AUX IN and OUTPUT connectors are all 3.5mm mono.\nSOUND OUTPUT: The Metal Synth is capable of generating a wide range of frequencies and as such will work best with a wide range speaker/amplifier rather than a typical guitar/bass amp.\n## Power ##\nGet yourself a 9V PP3 battery to use with the battery-barrel jack connector supplied in your kit for a mobile device or if you would prefer a power supply make sure its rated +8V to +12V DC and has a centre positive barrel jack. 2.1mm (centre) x 5.5mm (outside)\n### Kit Assembly ##\nThis kit requires skill and precision to complete, but trust us when we say it is well worth the effort!! The only equipment needed to complete this kit is a soldering iron and a pair of flush cutters. We provide 2m of lead free solder!\nThe easy to follow assembly guide can be followed online at rakits.co.uk. The guide contains high resolution pictures, handy hints and tips to help you along the way!\nWe are unable to provide individual customer support with kit building so please see the detailed assembly guide to gauge difficulty before purchasing. Once started, kits cannot be refunded.\nGift wrapping option is available at checkout. Please leave us a note with your chosen style (option 1-5 pictured in listing photos) and the message you would like us to write in the card!",

   "description": "This superior quality Arduino shield kit comes with all components plus Arduino Alarm Clock Project example software, and fits both the Mega and Uno boards.\nDesigned for the hobbyist and for everyone interested in electronics, the project is ideal for learning about electronics and software, with a very useful end product you can be proud to show as something you built.\nAt the heart of your project is the DS3231 high accuracy digital clock chip. This chip is surface mount and will be soldered onto your PCB for you before dispatch (please message me if you'd like to solder this yourself).\nYour project shield PCB is the same size as a standard Arduino Mega, with the pin connections and software compatible with both the Mega and also with the Uno - so you can use either your Mega or your Uno to build your alarm clock project. Just plug the shield on, program the Arduino, and away it goes.\nThe time is displayed in 24 hour format Hours, Minutes and Seconds, and there is a 'PM' LED for when the hour is 12 or greater. The colons between the time digits blink once per second.\nThe six 7-segment digital displays and LEDs are available as a choice of Red (0.5\"), or Green or White (green and white are slightly bigger at 0.56\") - just choose your colour when ordering. The LEDs for the blinking colons, alarm and PM indications are supplied as standard with colours matching the 7-segment displays - but you can choose any unique colour combination that you want - just send me a message or type what you would like into the \"Personalise\" when ordering. The 7-segment displays are supplied with sockets; you can choose to use the sockets or to solder the displays directly to the PCB, whichever is best for your project.\nThe alarm is set in 24 hour format. An alarm LED lights when the alarm is set to sound. When the alarm time is reached, the on-board beeper sounds until you either press a button or it will silence itself after a minute of sounding.\nThree pushbuttons are used to set the clock and alarm times.\nA CR1220 lithium battery acts as a backup for the DS3231 chip, so if you disconnect power to your Arduino, the clock time is still maintained and is resumed when you next power up your Arduino.\nYour kit comes complete with detailed assembly instructions to help you to assemble, and a description of what each component does that you can learn from.\nAlso supplied is the Arduino project software source code example of an alarm clock, which you can learn from and modify yourself.\nThis alarm clock shield kit contains all components and PCB for the shield, and you use your own Mega or Uno.\nPrepared for dispatch in an antistatic environment, packaged in an ESD protective bag, and sent to you in a padded jiffy bag.\nThis kit requires good soldering skills.\nThis kit is not suitable for small children due to small parts.\nComes with full technical support.\n(Please note that the supplied software is for you as the kit purchaser to learn from and to modify as you wish, but is not for resale).",

I will be more than happy to work with you on any sign design requirements you may have.\n--------HOW IT’S MADE-------\nEach piece is cut by hand from light weight yet extremely durable brushed aluminum composite metal. Aluminum composite is a compound of polymer sandwiched between two sheets of aluminum which makes it lightweight but very durable and weatherproof. The sign is then overlaid by hand with cut vinyl lettering and design and each is finished with holes drilled for hanging and corners smoothed and rounded. The sign is simple to either hang using rope, string, or bungees. For a more permanent fixing, use plugs and screws with washers to attach to wood or concrete or use nuts and bolts to attach to posts. The sign will not rust or stain and therefore will not require any significant maintenance or routine cleaning. Simply wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth.\n--------TO ORDER --------\nIf you would like any personalization be sure to provide instructions. I can cater for all fonts, styles and languages so please let me know your specific requirements.\n-------- SHIPPING --------\nAll orders are designed, created, packaged and shipped by me. Most items are created and ready for shipping within two to three days from receipt of order. Personalized signs and gift orders may take a little longer so please be patient.

   "description": "Tiger Electronic is a great vintage handheld. Disney's The Lion King comes is in good condition considering its age with some surface scratches / scuffs. This is a common fault. The battery cover is still present and opens and closes fine. The Lion King is fully working when batteries are inserted. It is stamped with '1994 Tiger Electronics, Inc. Made In China' on the back. The original instructions are present with some creasing/speckly marks to the cover. It also includes its original cardback/plastic packaging which has been opened along the sides/bottom and has some wear, a tint of yellow, splits/cracks, sellotape and edges missing, as shown but this doesn't detract from this great vintage game in any way. It has an impressive illustration on the front and is printed with 'Disney', '1994 Tiger Electronics, Inc.' and 'Printed in Hong Kong' on the back. Tiger Electronic displays nicely and is a must for any Lion King or retro gaming fan.",

   "description": "The Crystal Set Radio is radio in its simplest form, even so it can provide hours of fun, entertainment, and achievement.\nIt is one of my favourite electronic experiments, perhaps because it doesn't matter if you wire up the kit parts wrongly you can't damage them or yourself. The lifeblood of a crystal set is the aerial and earth, it is trapping a signal with the aerial and dissipating it to earth through the set that makes listening possible.\nThis kit contains everything you need to get started, there is even an easy to follow coil winding data sheet applicable to your UK area.\nThere are ten main parts supplied, three of which are generous amounts of different wire that you will find very useful. The semiconductor used is a special type of diode, I have included two slightly different versions for you to try.\nFor distance reception a large external aerial will greatly enhance the performance of this little receiver. This simple set needs high impedance headphones or the crystal earpiece that is supplied. Two versions of the special diode needed are included for you to try. This is a very simple one diode receiver using the minimum of components. The results are usually excellent, but reception will very much depend on atmospheric conditions and aerial/earth quality.\nThere is a data sheet for coil winding which at the moment, covers most areas of the UK. If you are intending to use the kit outside of the UK, it will still work, but a greater degree of experimentation of coil lengths will be required.\nI wish you success with your Crystal Set building, experimenting, and reception.\nHappy Experimenting.\nGrandad Bob",

The sync signals on VGA are isolated on their own wires and not effected by this device at all. You can glitch as heavy as you want and it will come out as a valid signal. A game changer for VJs and live glitch artists who dont want to lug around a big video mixer, TBC or even a CRT and a Camera.

The module has a LED behind the transparent panel making it possible to monitor signal levels.\nMany thanks to Tom Whitwell of Music thing modular and Emille Gillet of MI for their inspiration and for sharing their knowledge .\nLovingly hand soldered and built at Beepboop Electronics Workshop.\nIncludes power ribbon, mounting screws and 1 year Warranty\nI also have a few piezo acessiories avaliable on my website including Hydrophones, Piezos in Tins and EMR detectors1?!!!\nhttps://www.modulargrid.net/e/beepboop-electronics-2hp-kontact-mic",
